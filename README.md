# EC_320_Summer_2023

## Course Description

EC 320 provides an introduction to the process and methods of econometrics. Econometrics concerns the use of economic data to estimate economic relationships, to statistically evaluate hypotheses, and to forecast. My goal is that you come away from this course with an understanding of basic econometric methods, as well as an ability to apply them to answer interesting questions.

## Policies

### Homework (20% of Grade)

Homework will be assigned weekly and will consist of problems that focus on the foundations of econometrics. These problems will be largely math based. To submit the assignment, you will fill in a Quiz on Canvas by the due date. You are allowed to work with others, but must submit your assignment on your own. Each Canvas Quiz will have a spot for you to upload your work so that you can obtain partial credit for incorrect answers.

| Problem Set | Link to Questions | Due Date |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 | Questions | Sunady 7/2 |
| 2 | Questions | Sunday 7/9 |
| 3 | Questions | Sunday 7/16 |
| 4 | Questions | **Thursday** 7/20 |

### Labs (20% of Grade)

Throughout the course we will have labs where you will get a chance to practice application of the ecometrics methods learned so far. These labs will consist of example code for applying the most resent chapter. You will be asked comprehesion questions about the output from the example code that will be graded for accuracy. You will then be given a chance to use what you have learned to do your own data analysis. The data analysis will be graded on effort. You should be able to complete all lab assignments during class. They will be due at midnight the day after we work on them. 

### Exams (60% of Grade)

There will be 2 exams during this course. The midterm will be held on **monday July, 10**, and the final will be held on **friday, July 21**. These exams will be on Canvas. They will only be available during the normal class time, 12:00 - 1:50 PST. You must work by yourself on the exam, but the exam is open note and open book. 

### Attendance

Attendance is not required for this course, however, I strongly recommend coming to each class so that you can work on the labs and problem sets in real time. By the nature of a summer course, this class moves at a fast pace, and it is very easy to fall behind from missing a lecture.
